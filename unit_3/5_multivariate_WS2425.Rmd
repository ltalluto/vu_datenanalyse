## Multivariate statistics - in R
What you have learned so far (among other things):
![](img/test table.png){width=80}


However, ecological datasets often have one or both of these datasets (if not more):

![](img/mv_table.png){width=800%}



## A short intro to classical ordination methods - in R
**Ordination** is an umbrella term for multivariate methods which arrange data along a
gradient (axis, scale). A sloppy explanation is "putting things in order".

**Ordination** is a word almost exclusively used by ecologists. Outside most of these methods are known as **scaling techniques**. The phrase **gradient analysis** makes a bit more sense in ecology.

## Principal component analysis (PCA)

PCA can be understood as a MLR on theoretical (latent) instead of observed dependent variables.

The regression coefficients in PCA are **factor loadings**.

The predicted values of the theoretical dependent are **scores**.

![](img/pca_data.png)

For instance, in a PCA on this matrix of n objects times p variables PC1 is computed as:

$$
PC_1=f_1X_1+f_2X_2+...+f_pX_p
$$
There must be as many PCs as original variables. The factor loading matrix translates p $X$-variables into p $PCs$.

PCA can be understood as a rotation of the original coordinate system made up of p $X$-variables into a new coordinate system defined by p $PCs$.

## Redundancy analysis (RDA) in R
The classical ordination methods always target **dimension reduction**

* are based on **linear or unimodal** relationships, and
* may involve **direct** regression on a 2nd matrix of explanatory variables (as opposed to **indirectly** reconstructing gradients from a single data matrix)

![](img/ordinations_table.png)


## Redundancy analysis (RDA) in R
<div class="left lt">

Two involved matrices: one dependent, one independent.

(Note: For correlation of two matrices see CCorA (Canonical correlation analysis) $\neq$ CCA.)

**Redundancy**: The proportion of total variance of in the response variables that can be explained linear combinations of predictors.

Two steps:

1. MLRs relate each response variable to the independent matrix and predict the response.
2. The matrix of predicted response variables (same size as original: n objects * p variables) is subject to PCA.

The response variables are **constrained** to be linear combinations of the predictors first! The PCA can only "ordinate" variation of the responses that is relatable to predictors.

Significance tests for the overall model, for the various RDA-axes and for the individual predictors are available (permutation-based).

* One set of *unconstrained* scores (site scores), $YU$.
* One set of *constrained* scores (LC scores), $\hat{Y}U$.

## Correspondence Analysis (CA)

<div class="left lt">

Based on one matrix (usually a *species* or *community* matrix).

Considers unimodal responses to (unknown) environmental variables.

An *indirect* GA, resulting gradients are synthetic environmental gradients.

The basis for CA is **weighted averaging** from environmental and species tables. If *env* exists, then this can be done to extract *bioindicatory information*:

$$
u^*=\frac{y_1x_1+y_2x_2+...+y_nx_n}{y_1+y_2+...+y_n}
$$
A *species optimum* $u^*$ is computed as an abundance-weighted means of a specific environmental variable over all sites at which a specific species is present.

This approach works best when:

* Species have narrow amplitude.
* Environmental variable spans the whole range of the species¬¥ tolerance curve with good spacing.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

CA uses a *two-way weighted averaging* with a theoretical environmental variable iteratively in several steps:

1. Take *arbitrary* site scores.
2. Derive species scores by weighted average of sites scores, for species k (of m):
$$
u_k=\sum_{i=1}^n{y_{ki}x_i}/\sum_{i=1}^n{y_{ki}}
$$
3. From the species scores new site scores can be derived, for site i (of n):
$$
x_i=\sum_{k=1}^m{y_{ki}u_k}/\sum_{k=1}^n{y_{ki}}
$$
4. Rescaling (standardization) of site and species scores.
5. Repeat 2-3 several times until stabilisation of site and species scores = first CA axis.
6. Similar procedure to construct second CA axis (uncorrelated to first).

</div>


## Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)

Two involved matrices: one dependent, one independent.

In the reciprocal averaging of CA a constraint is included:

* Site scores are linearly (!) regressed on the independent dataset (environment).
* Predicted values for the site scores are then used to compute the species scores. 

The result are axes which inform about **species-site relationships**, but which also have **maximized correlation with linear combinations of (environmental) predictors**.

Site scores:

* One set of *unconstrained* scores (WA scores), similar but not identical to CA-results
* One set of *constrained* scores (LC scores), usually the ones of interest
