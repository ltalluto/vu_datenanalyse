## Multivariate statistics - in R
What you have learned so far (among other things):

A multitude of analyses how to describe the effect of one or multiple variables on **one** response/dependent variable 
![](img/test table.png){width=60%}

<br/>

However, what can we do if we have **more than one** response/dependent variable?  
Ecological datasets often have one or both of these datasets (if not more):

![](img/mv_table.png){width=80%}



## A short intro to classical ordination methods - in R
**Ordination** is an umbrella term for multivariate methods which arrange data along a
gradient (axis, scale).

A sloppy explanation is "putting things in order".

**Ordination** is a word almost exclusively used by ecologists. Outside most of these methods are known as **scaling techniques**.

## Principal component analysis (PCA)

PCA reduces the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of its variability. Hence, reduces the complexity of high-dimensonal data and can identify hidden patterns.

PCA converts the original set of variables into a new set of variables called principal components (PCs), which represent the main patterns of variation.



![](img/PCA_explained.png){width=100%}

PCA can be understood as a MLR on theoretical (latent) instead of observed dependent variables.

The regression coefficients in PCA are **factor loadings**.

The predicted values of the theoretical dependent are **scores**.

![](img/pca_data.png)

For instance, in a PCA on this matrix of n objects times p variables PC1 is computed as:

$$
PC_1=f_1X_1+f_2X_2+...+f_pX_p
$$
There must be as many PCs as original variables. The factor loading matrix translates p $X$-variables into p $PCs$.

PCA can be understood as a rotation of the original coordinate system made up of p $X$-variables into a new coordinate system defined by p $PCs$.

# correlate PCA-axes with other potential "controlling" variables (e.g. canopy cover) to give "meta-dimensions" more meaning

# The function envfit calculates multiple regression of environmental variable with ordination axes (environmental variable is used as dependent and selected ordination axes as explanatory variables). Significance is tested by permutation test. Vectors (for continual variables) and centroids (for categorical variables) can be projected onto ordination diagram using plot function.

## Direct (constrained) ordination
The classical ordination methods always target **dimension reduction** and may involve **indirect** (unconstrained) reconstruction of gradients from a single data matrix (e.g. PCA) or **direct** (constrained) regression on a 2nd matrix of explanatory variables (e.g. RDA).

Constrained ordinations aim to explain the variation in a set of response variables using a set of explanatory variables.

<br/>

![](img/ordinations_table.png)

## Redundancy analysis (RDA)
<div class="left lt">

**Direct ordinations** identify the relationship between a multivariate response matrix and a multivariate explanatory matrix by combining regression and ordination concepts.

**Two involved matrices**: one dependent, one independent.

Steps in RDA

1. Multiple linear regression relate each dependent/response variable (eg. species abundances, DOM descriptors) to the independent/explanatory matrix (e.g. environmental variables, land use) and predict the response.

2. The matrix of predicted response variables (same size as original: number of sites/samples/objects * number of variables) is used in PCA to extract constrained ordination axes. Hence, RDA is a canonical version of PCA where the PCs are constrained to be linear combinations of the explanatory variables.

3. The matrix of the residuals is also used in PCA to extract unconstrained axes.

Differences to PCA: 

1. The RDA can only "ordinate" variation of the responses that is relatable to predictors. Hence, gradients in the response matrix, which cannot be related to the explanatory matrix (as linear combinations), cannot be identified. Assume the most important environmental variable was not measured in the sampling campaign -> compare PCA to RDA.

2. Often we are interested in the amount and significance of variation in the response matrix (e.g. species composition) that can be explained by the explanatory matrix (e.g. environmental variables). Significance tests are available (permutation-based).

## Unimodal relationships
The classical ordination methods always target **dimension reduction** 

* They may involve **indirect** (unconstrained) reconstruction of gradients from a single data matrix (e.g. PCA) or **direct** (constrained) regression on a 2nd matrix of explanatory variables (e.g. RDA)

* They are based on **linear** or **unimodal** relationships.

## Correspondence Analysis (CA)
<div class="left lt">

Based on **one** matrix (usually a *species* or *community* matrix).

Considers **unimodal** responses to (unknown) environmental variables.

**Indirect** gradient analysis, resulting gradients are synthetic environmental gradients.

PCA on datasets with many zeros produces artefacts (horseshoe effects). Such datasets need ‘unimodal’ methods (e.g. CA) or transform-based PCA or distance-based methods.

CA does not take into account cases where the value of a variable in two different objects is zero.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

The basis for CA is **weighted averaging** from environmental and species tables. If *env* exists, then this can be done to extract *bioindicatory information*:

$$
u^*=\frac{y_1x_1+y_2x_2+...+y_nx_n}{y_1+y_2+...+y_n}
$$
A *species optimum* $u^*$ is computed as an abundance-weighted means of a specific environmental variable over all sites at which a specific species is present.



![](img/CA_species_optimum.png){width=60%}


This approach works best when:

* Species have narrow amplitude.
* Environmental variable spans the whole range of the species´ tolerance curve.
</div>

## Correspondence Analysis (CA)
<div class="left lt">

CA uses a *two-way weighted averaging* with a theoretical environmental variable iteratively in several steps:

1. Take *arbitrary* site scores.
2. Derive species scores by weighted average of sites scores, for species k (of m):
$$
u_k=\sum_{i=1}^n{y_{ki}x_i}/\sum_{i=1}^n{y_{ki}}
$$
3. From the species scores new site scores can be derived, for site i (of n):
$$
x_i=\sum_{k=1}^m{y_{ki}u_k}/\sum_{k=1}^n{y_{ki}}
$$
4. Rescaling (standardization) of site and species scores.
5. Repeat 2-3 several times until stabilisation of site and species scores = first CA axis.
6. Similar procedure to construct second CA axis (uncorrelated to first).

## Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)

**Unimodal constraint** ordination method

**Two involved matrices**: one dependent, one independent.

In the reciprocal averaging of CA a constraint (e.g. environmental variable) is included:

* Site scores are linearly (!) regressed on the independent dataset (environment).
* Predicted values for the site scores are then used to compute the species scores. 

The result are axes which inform about **species-site relationships**, but which also have **maximized correlation with linear combinations of (environmental) predictors**.

<br/>

Site scores:

* One set of *unconstrained* scores (WA scores), similar but not identical to CA-results
* One set of *constrained* scores (LC scores), usually the ones of interest
