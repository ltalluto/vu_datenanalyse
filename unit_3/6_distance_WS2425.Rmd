## Methods based on distance/dissimilarity/similarity

![](img/distance.png){width=90%}
The most known dissimilarity is a (physical) distance: Euclidean distance, in a 2D-coordinate system it is just computed based on Pythagoras:

$$
d_{Euc}=\sqrt{\Delta{x_1}^2+\Delta{x_2}^2}
$$

Euclidean distance computed between any two sites for $p$ variables:

$$
d_{Euc}=\sqrt{\Delta{x_1}^2+\Delta{x_2}^2+...+\Delta{x_p}^2}
$$

## Why use dissimilarity-based methods?

<div class="left lt">

* Quantify how similar or how dissimilar various observations are with regard to many variables simultaneously.
* An efficient way to collapse information from a much too high-dimensional dataset.
* Use various variable types from continuous to presence-absence and qualitative, even simultaneously.
* Choice of appropriate dissimilarity coefficient may allow avoiding *strange* transformations.
* Better handling of double-zeros, less horseshoe patterns in ordinations in situations of strong community turnover.
* Similarity may be translated into dissimilarity and vice-versa.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

* An explicit way to express (and analyze) community turnover in space and time (beta-diversity).

Whenever compositional turnover at regional scale is of interest!

Diversity partitioning into $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$:

![](img/abg_div.png)
$\beta$-diversity is linked to species-accumulation curves.
</div>

##  (Dis)similarity coefficients

Euclidean and Bray-Curtis (Steinhaus, Sorenson) are two examples of many dissimilarity indices, here computed between any two sites for $p$ variables:

$$
d_{Euc}=\sqrt{\Delta{x_1}^2+\Delta{x_2}^2+...+\Delta{x_p}^2}
$$
where $\Delta{x}$ is the distance between two sites along any $X$-variable.

<br/>

$$
d_{BC}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^p{|x_{1j}-x_{2j}|}}{\sum_{j=1}^p{(x_{1j}+x_{2j})}}
$$
which includes a notable normalization of differences between two sites with regard to any variable used.


## (Dis)similarity coefficients: some properties

<div class="left lt">

* symmetrical: consider a double zero as contributing to resemblance just like any other value
* asymmetrical: skip double zeros, considering that these are not informative (absence of a species at two sites does not tell anything about how similar these sites are!)
* metric: minimum 0, positive for inequality, symmetric ($D_{(a,b)}=D_{(b,a)}$), triangle inequality holds

$$
D_{(a,b)}+D_{(b,c)}\geq{D_{(a,c)}}
$$
* semimetric: do not follow the triangle inequality

$$
D_{(a,b)}+D_{(b,c)}<{D_{(a,c)}}
$$
... in which case perfect projections into Euclidean space are not possible. Two often used transformations to make semimetric coefficients analyzable in Euclidean space are adding a constant or $\sqrt(D)$.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

<br/>

Triangle inequality: Distance via an intermediate point must be higher than or equal to distance without such an intermediate point. E.g. consider B as intermediate between A and C as in a triangle: the distance from A to C via B must be larger than the direct distance from A to C.

## Using dissimilarity: Cluster analysis

Hierarchical group-forming (clustering) based on pairwise (dis)similarity.

Three types:

1. Divisive: start with all, successively split into 2.
2. **Agglomerative**: start with individual observations and cluster pairwise, continue grouping clusters.
3. Non-hierarchical: e.g. K-means clustering (forcing K clusters)

<br/>

Various “linkage rules” to group clusters in agglomerative clustering:

* Single linkage looks for the nearest neighbour of any group member to other observations (tends to chaining). 
* **Average linkage** computes dissimilarities between two groups as the average dissimilarity among all pairwise group member dissimilarities (one from each cluster).
* **UPGMA** (unweighted-pair-groups method using arithmetic averages) is a version of an average linkage rule.

```


## Using dissimilarity: Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)

(aka *metric scaling*)

Technique to project sites onto Cartesian (Euclidean) coordinates from pairwise dissimilarities. 

Imagine a road distance matrix between major towns. A 2D-projection of all pairwise distances produces a map (which gets better with less mountains and straighter roads in the area).

PCoA can be regarded as the inverse operation to computing a distance matrix. However, it can´t produce more "axes" than (n-1) as this is the maximum number of dimensions needed to completely represent n objects. A dissimilarity matrix and a consecutive PCoA are efficient means to condense data with p>>n.

PCoA is an important step in hypothesis-testing methods in the distance domain (see later).

<br/>

PCoA is based on an eigenvector decomposition like PCA:

* fast (not iterative)
* results in dimensions of ranked importance as in PCA
* forces sites into a Euclidean space and may thus represent non-metric dissimilarities (e.g. Bray-Curtis) not so well
* *made for* Euclidean distance or coefficients that can be transformed adequately.
* To improve representation (avoid negative eigenvalues) add constant to D or $\sqrt(D)$.

plot(envfit(pcoa$points,lip_data)) # take care: behaviour of species not necessarily monotonous in ordination space
```


## Using dissimilarity: Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)

An iterative search for an ordination configuration in a low-dimensional space with inter-object distances representing the observed dissimilarity/distance matrix as well as possible.

The measure of fit used is not actual dissimarity/distance but rank order of dissimilarities.

Iterative procedure:

1. Compute matrix of dissimilarities.
2. Decide on k, the number of dimensions.
3. Arrange objects in a random starting configuration.
4. Compute a measure of fit that expresses the match between inter-object distances of the configuration and the observed dissimilarities.  A **Shepard-plot** shows residuals as stress which is inversely related to fit. The measure of fit is computed using **ranks of observed dissimilarities and configuration distances**.
5. Reiteratively reposition the objects in the low-dimensional space and recompute fit to improve the match between inter-object distances and observed dissimilarities.
6. A final configuration is achieved when no more repositioning improves the fit. Steps 3) to 6) may be repeated with different random starting positions to avoid getting trapped in local minima.

## Hypothesis tests in the distance world


All known *study designs* with factors or continuous predictors may be transferred to the distance domain.

* PERMANOVA: An ANOVA-type of analysis testing effects of factors (also in interaction) on a multivariate matrix, thus MANOVA. Useful to test effects on *composition*. In the distance domain known as *permutational* MANOVA. In R implemented as `vegan::adonis`.

* dbRDA (distance-based RDA) and CAP (canonical analysis of principal coordinates): multiple-step analysis to test for effects of continuous predictors on a dissimilarity matrix. In R `vegan::capscale`.

* Mantel-test: An old-school test for correlation between two distance/dissimilarity matrices (e.g. one describing environment or physical distance, the other describing community turnover or genetic differentiation).  In R `vegan::mantel`.

## Permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA)

<div class="left lt">

Uses a test statistic based on distances within groups (to a group centroid or averaged among all pairs) versus distances from group centroids to the overall centroid.

<br/>

![](img/permanova.png){width=80%}

</div>

<div class="right rt">

1. The within-group sum of squares is the sum of squared distances from individual replicates to their group centroid.
2. The among-group sum of squares is the sum of squared distances from group centroids to the overall centroid.
3. A (pseudo-) F-value is computed using number of groups (a) and the total number of observations (N) as:
$$
F=\frac{SS_A/(a-1)}{SS_w/(N-a)}
$$
4. Significance is assessed by recomputing the test-statistic after permutations of group assignment.

<br/>

Prerequisite similar to ANOVA: homogeneous dispersion (multivariate variance, *cloud shape*). Tested using within-group distances to centroids.

</div>

## Permutational MANOVA (PERMANOVA)

```{r}
# PERMANOVA - non-parametric permutational MANOVA #
# a multivariate hypothesis test: 
# two factors and 1 multivariate response = "membrane FA composition"

# first testing for homogeneity of dispersion (homogeneous distances to group centroids)
disp.check<-betadisper(lipids_distBC,combifac)
disp.check$distances
boxplot(disp.check$distances~combifac)
anova(lm(disp.check$distances~combifac))
anova(disp.check)
permutest(disp.check)

# the actual PERMANOVA
adonis(lipids_distBC~isolate*temperature)
```

## Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP)

<div class="left lt">

Following scheme taken from description of db-RDA. Essentially 3 steps:

1. Computation of a (square) dissimilarity matrix D from (Cartesian) raw data. Choose coefficient well!
2. PCoA based on D *recreates* Cartesian coordinates with a dimensionality imposed by n (or p if p<n). If D was semimetric, (minor) axes with negative eigenvalues may occur.
3. RDA on the PCoA-axes and constraints of choice (factors/dummy variables, continuous predictors). Instead of RDA other constrained methods are possible as well, e.g. discriminant analysis, other classification routines, etc.

## Canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP)

```{r}
cap<-capscale(lipids_distBC~isolate*temperature)
summary(cap)

anova(cap,by="axis",model="direct",perm.max=9999,step=1000)
anova(cap,by="terms",model="direct",perm.max=9999,step=1000)

# all functions more or less taken from RDA
# e.g. to get site scores for plotting
#scores(cap,display="sites")[,1:2]
```
