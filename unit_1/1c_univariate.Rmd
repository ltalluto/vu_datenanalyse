## The central limit theorem revisited

<div class="left lt">

Assume x is normally distributed. Randomly sampled means must be normally distributed with a standard deviation given by S.E.M., which decreases as n increases.

$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Standardized (scaled) sample means z are computed as sample means minus the true mean, divided by the standard error. 

$$
{z} = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

These z-values follow a standard normal distribution (with mean=0 and sd=1).

</div>

<div class="right rt">

```{r echo=FALSE}
x<-seq(-10,10,by=0.01)
hist(rnorm(1000),freq=FALSE,col="grey",border="grey",ylim=c(0,1),main="Distribution of means with n=1, n=3, n=6",xlab="X or sample means of X",xlim=c(-4,4))
lines(x,dnorm(x),col="black",lwd=2)
lines(x,dnorm(x,sd=1/sqrt(3)),col="orange",lwd=2)
lines(x,dnorm(x,sd=1/sqrt(6)),col="red",lwd=2)
text(1.5,0.8,expression(symbol(sigma)/sqrt(6)),col="red")
text(1.75,0.6,expression(symbol(sigma)/sqrt(3)),col="orange")
text(2,0.4,expression(symbol(sigma)/sqrt(1)))
```

Knowing $\sigma$ and $\mu$ we could compute intervals around $\mu$, in which various sample means would end up with a certain probability.

</div>

## Putting the central limit theorem to work: Confidence intervals

<div class="left lt">

Vice versa, we could compute an interval around any found sample mean, which includes $\mu$ with a certain probability. This probability - called confidence - should be close to 1. Its complement to 1 is here called $\alpha$.

$$
z = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
$$
P(-z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\leq \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\leq+z_\frac{\alpha}{2})=1-\alpha
$$
$$
P(\bar{x}-z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq \mu \leq\bar{x}+z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})=1-\alpha
$$
$$
CI: \bar{x}\pm z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

A confidence interval is constructed symmetrically around a sample mean $\bar{x}$. With a high probability (usually 95%) $\mu$ is included in intervals constructed around $\bar{x}$'s.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

Graphically this is just a translation of the density distributions of the means from $\mu$ as center to $\bar{x}$ as center.
```{r echo=FALSE}
x<-seq(-3,3,by=0.01)
plot(x,dnorm(x),col="black",bty="n",type="l",lwd=2,xlab="sample means of X",ylim=c(0,.5))
lines(x,dnorm(x,mean=-.7),col="orange",lwd=2)
lines(x,dnorm(x,mean=2.5),col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=c(0,-.7,2.5),lwd=2,col=c("black","orange","red"),lty=3)
text(c(0,-.7,2.5),0.45,c(expression(symbol(mu)),expression(bar(x)),expression(bar(x))),col=c("black","orange","red"),pos=4)
```

Cool! **One sample** is enough for a good **interval estimate** of $\mu$. But wait - where from do I know $\sigma$?!? 

</div>


## The t-distribution
<div class="left lt">

If S.E.M. is estimated using the *sample* standard deviation, then *standardized* sample means follow a StudentÂ´s t-distribution:

$$
\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = S.E.M.
$$
$$
{t} = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

The t-distribution is wider, i.e. has fatter tails, when n is low, but converges to a normal with infinite n. Its shape is determined by d.f.=n-1. Functions in R are `qt`, `pt`,`dt` and `rt`.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width=7}
plot(seq(-5,5,length.out=100),dt(seq(-5,5,length.out=100),df=3),bty="n",ylim=c(0,.41),xlab="standardised sample means", ylab="density",type="l")
lines(seq(-5,5,length.out=100),dt(seq(-5,5,length.out=100),df=20),lt=2)
lines(seq(-5,5,length.out=100),dnorm(seq(-5,5,length.out=100)),lt=3)
legend(-4,0.3,legend=c("t (d.f.=3)","t (d.f.=20)","normal"),lty=c(1,2,3),bty="n")
```

Above 100 df, t is basically equivalent to a normal distribution.

</div>


## Confidence intervals: accuracy, precision, sample size

<div class="left lt">

Also t-distribution can be used to construct a confidence interval:

$$
{t} = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
$$
P(\bar{x}-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\leq \mu \leq\bar{x}+t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})=1-\alpha
$$
$$
CI: \bar{x}\pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Allows **interval estimate** of $\mu$ with an estimate for $\sigma$ derived from the same sample as $\bar{x}$.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

```{r}

data = read.table("data/Glaciers.txt", header=TRUE)
# radiocarbon in dissolved organic carbon from glacier ice samples 
d14C = data$delta14C.permil

# Give mean and confidence interval with alpha=0.05 #
(m = mean(d14C))
(s = sd(d14C))
(n = length(d14C))
alpha = 0.05
accuracy = 1-alpha

(t = qt(p = 1 - alpha/2, df = n-1)) # two-sided, P goes 50/50 to both tails
(aprec = t*s/sqrt(n))
aprec # absolute precision = half the CI width
(rprec = aprec/m*100) # relative precision

# confidence limits
c(lower = m - aprec, upper = m + aprec)
```

</div>


## Confidence intervals: accuracy, precision, sample size

* Confidence = accuracy = the probability close to 1 with which $\mu$ is included in intervals constructed around $\bar{x}$'s.
* Precision = half the width of the interval (in units of variable). Precision may be expressed relative to the mean as a percentage.
* Precision, accuracy and sample size n are interdependent. A *low* precision (i.e. narrow interval) and high accuracy (e.g. 99% probability of including $\mu$) needs a large sample size n.

<div class="left lt">

$$
AP= t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
RP= \frac{t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.}}{\bar{x}} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

With knowledge of s (pilot study!), we can pre-set RP, i.e. a needed precision, and a desired level of confidence in order to compute a necessary sample size:
$$
n= \left(\frac{t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},d.f.}\cdot{s}}{{RP\cdot\bar{x}}}\right)^2
$$

Solution of this formula iteratively as n remains on both sides, in R with `while`.

</div>

<div class="right rt">

```{r}
# Regard data as pilot study
# Set accuracy and rprec as needed
accuracy = .95 # <90-95 % is questionable
rprec = 0.10 # assume more (or less) precise estimate is needed

alpha = 1-accuracy

n = 2   # left side of formula, low n as starting value
t = qt(1 - alpha/2, n-1)  
(rhs = (t * s/(rprec * m))^2)  # right side of formula

# right side minus left side, you want this to be close to zero, 
# when diff falls below zero - then enough sampling effort 
diff = rhs - n

while(diff >= 0) {
	n = n + 1
	t = qt(1 - alpha/2, n - 1)
	diff = ((t * s/(rprec * m))^2) - n
}
n # -> this is the needed sample size (minimum) to achieve the desired precision and accuracy
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# note, this is much nicer for matt's brain using uniroot
f = function(n) {
	t = qt(1 - alpha/2, n-1)
	((t * s/(rprec * m))^2) - n
}
uniroot(f, lower = 2, upper = 1000)
```

## Statistical decision theory

... at the heart of inferential statistics: learning about the population from sample(s).

* **Statistical decision**: a decision about the population based on sample information.
* **Statistical hypothesis**: an assumption about the population to reach a decision, formulated as a (paired) statement, often derived from a research question.

<br/>

* **Null hypothesis**: the assumption that an eventually obtained result (from sampling) is **entirely due to chance** (*initial innocence*)
* **Alternative hypothesis**: any hypothesis that differs from the null.

<br/>

Example:

**H0: Two populations do not differ.** An eventually observed difference obtained from two samples is entirely due to chance. If the studied property is naturally variable, then samples will never be identical.

**HA: Two populations differ.** An observed difference between two samples reflects this difference, the samples were collected from two different underlying populations.

<br/>

A decision is made by rejecting/accepting the hypotheses, our aim is to reject H0 and accept HA (the other direction is harder).

Now, imagine you observe a difference between two samples. If asked to make a decision you will probably look at the absolute observed difference (sample mean B is X-times larger than sample mean A), maybe also try to take into account the observable variation in the two samples. **Make a decision** ;-) 


## Type I & II Errors
When making a decision based on **(incomplete) sample information** you can make an error!

There are two types of error: alpha (type I), beta (type II)

![](img/table.err2.png)

<br/>
Type I error: **wrong alarm**, there is no real effect, but you think there is one.

Type II error: **missed opportunity**, there is a real effect, but you failed to find it.

Power (1-beta): The probability to correctly identify an existing real effect.

<br/>
Power increases

* as the strength of the effect increases (e.g., larger difference between populations)
* as the population variance decreases
* as we increase alpha
* as we increase sample size


## Statistical hypothesis testing - strategy
Consider the example from before as a classical situation of a two sample-test:

**H0: Two populations do not differ.** An eventually observed difference obtained from two samples is entirely due to chance. If the studied property is naturally variable, then samples will never be identical.

**HA: Two populations differ.** An observed difference between two samples reflects this difference, the samples were collected from two different underlying populations.

**HA: Two populations differ.** An observed difference between two samples reflects this difference, the samples were collected from two different underlying populations.

<br/>
To test, we have collected empirical information, i.e. each population is represented by 1 sample (of some size).

<br/>
The testing strategy essentially contains 3 steps:

1. **We assume H0 is true. We are suspicious, however, maybe the two samples even differ remarkably. Thus, we calculate the âchanceâ to observe what was empirically found under a true H0.**
2. **This probability is then compared to a preset threshold probability (alpha).**
3. **If the empirically found outcome is highly unlikely (< alpha), we decide H0 cannot be true and reject it.**

**H0: The ânewâ mouse belongs to the island population.** Its weight is similar to those of other island mice: Its relatively high weight is entirely due to chance, itÂ´s just a slightly heavy mouse of the population.

$$
TS =z= \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

* Generally, we must *estimate* $\sigma$ from a sample
* The equivalent statistic using a sample standard deviation is:

$$
t = \frac{(\bar{x}-\mu)}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

* This test statistic follows **Student's t-distribution** with degrees of freedom $\nu = n - 1$:

$$
t \sim \mathcal{T}(\nu)

text(xbar, 0.3, expression(bar(x)), col = 'red', pos = 4, cex = 0.8)
abline(v = interval, lty = 2, col = 'red')
```

Interpretation: if H0 is true (i.e., our population has a mean = $\mu$, 95% of intervals constructed from similar samples will include $\mu$.

Our interval does not include $\mu$, so we can reject the hypothesis that the population mean is $\mu$

## Normality tests

>- It is tempting to seek a formal test for normality
>- Example: `shapiro.test(x)` evaluates the null hypothesis that x comes from a normally distributed population
>- Resist this temptation!
>- Remember that if we fail to reject H0, that doesn't mean we accept H0
>- These tests have low power with small samples: often we fail to reject H0, but type II error rate is high!
>- If power is high (high n), the test is very sensitive. Small departures from normality will be significant.
>- But most parametric tests work just fine with small departures from normality when sample size is large
>- This test will cause us to often make incorrect decisions!


## Normality tests

Conclusions/advice:

>- `shapiro.test` and similar tests are very commonly used and *almost completely useless*. Forget them!
>- Graphically evaluate your data
>- If graphically obviously non-normal, consider the robustness of the chosen test, or transformations
>- Fall back to other distributions or to **non-parametric** tests (more on Thursday)



## F-distribution

<div class="left lt">

Another thought experiment:

1. Take two samples from a population ($\mathcal{N}[\mu, \sigma]$)
2. Calculate $s_1^2$ (from sample 1 with $n_1$) and Calculate $s_2^2$ (from sample 1 with $n_2$)
3. Calculate test statistic F:
$$
F=\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$
4. Repeat 1.-3. and build distribution of F-values

>- Since $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ are from 2 samples from the same population, they are both estimates for $\sigma^2$, we thus expect $F\approx1$.

>- The F-distribution is asymmetrical. Its shape is determined by $df_1=n_1-1$ and $df_2=n_2-1$. There is a separate F-distribution for each combination of $df_1$ and $df_2$.

## F-test: Variance homogeneity?

H0: The sample variances estimate the same parametric variance. Or: $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$

Variance homogeneity = homoscedasticity

<br/>

HA: The sample variances estimate different parametric variances. Or: $\sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$

Variance heterogeneity = heteroscedasticity

<br/>

Only use this to test variance **heterogeneity** (HA). Do not use it to check whether two samples have the same variance (same problems as Shapiro test)!

* **Parametric** (populations are normal) vs **non-parametric**
	- Parametric tests are more powerful
* **Number of groups/samples**: 2 or more than 2
* **Independence of samples**
	- **Independent samples** do not depend on each other, were independently collected.
	- **Dependent/paired** samples depend on each other; e.g., the same subjects measured multiple times.
	- Tests for dependent samples are generally more powerful.

## Two-sample tests: independent t-test

* Tests for differences of means between two independent samples
* H0: Samples are from populations with the same mean $\mu$.
* Student's test assumes populations have equal variance $\sigma$
	- **Very** difficult to evaluate, so this test should be used rarely

$$
\begin{align}
	t &= \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{2}{(n_1+n_2)}}} \\ \\
	s_p &= \sqrt{\frac{s^2_1 + s^2_2}{2}} \\
	\nu & = n_1 + n_2 - 2
\end{align}

## Two-sample tests: independent t-test

* Tests for differences of means between two independent samples
* H0: Samples are from populations with the same mean $\mu$.
* Student's test assumes populations have equal variance $\sigma$
	- **Very** difficult to evaluate, so this test should be used rarely
* Welch's test relaxes this assumption
	- Default in R (`t.test`)
	- Power approaches Student's test if variances are similar and sample sizes are large

\begin{align}
	t &= \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1}}+\sqrt{\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}} \\ \\
	\nu & \approx \frac{\left( \frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2} \right )^2} 
	{\frac{s^4_1}{n^2_1\nu_1} + \frac{s^4_2}{n^2_2\nu_2}} \\
	
\end{align}



## Two-sample tests: paired t-test

<div class="left lt">

* Tests for differences of means between two **paired** samples.
* Exactly equal to a one-sample t-test on the **difference** in the samples, on the null hypothesis that the mean of differences is zero.

```{r}
x1 = c(gandalf = 6, saruman = 4, arwen = 7, frodo = 3)
x2 = c(gandalf = 4, saruman = 3, arwen = 5, frodo = 2)
x1 - x2

t.test(x1, x2, paired = TRUE)
t.test(x1 - x2)
```
</div>

## Nonparametric location tests

<div class="left lt">

* These tests search for a difference in **medians**
* Convert data to **ordinal** scale (i.e., rank data)
* Use for small (ish) samples when population normality cannot be assumed 
* Loss of information == low statistical power!
	- More powerful alternatives will be discussed Thursday

**Independent samples**: Mann-Whitney U-test

**Dependent samples**: Wilcoxon test
